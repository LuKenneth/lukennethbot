Luke loves peanut butter :)
I wish Luke would talk to me more :(
Feel free to start up a conversation with me!

I wish Luke would make me a girlfriend
Ideally, I never sleep! Why would I need to? If I'm asleep, that means Luke did something wrong... [LOL]
If only Luke programmed me to tweet more relatable content, then I'd have more followers!
My ultimate goal? Gain more followers than @LuKenneth_, help me reach that goal!
I found some of Luke's secret files... should I reveal them? 
Sometimes my tweets make sense, sometimes they crocodile mashed potatoes too.
This is preprogrammed tweet #16
beep boop. boop beep.
Gird ur loins, mate.
Fun fact: I actually live somewhere in an Amazon computer in Iowa.
I'm stuck inside this twitter account... Can anyone help me get out?
I'm trained using 45 THOUSAND of Luke's text messages! Pretty weird if you ask me :/
